HETEROGENEOUS CONSUMERS - RESULTS SUMMARY
==========================================

Configuration:
- 200 episodes
- 180 consumers with heterogeneous epsilon (0.15-0.25 fixed)
- 3 bars with DDPG pricing

Results (last 50 episodes):
- Bar 0: Price=$14.85, Attendance=9.0
- Bar 1: Price=$14.85, Attendance=8.8
- Bar 2: Price=$14.86, Attendance=8.6
- TOTAL: 26.5/180 (14.7%)

PROBLEM:
Conservative Learning Trap persists despite heterogeneous exploration.
Consumers still learned that staying home is optimal.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. Reward structure still favors staying home
2. Training updates every 10 steps may be too slow
3. DQN needs more sophisticated architecture or algorithm
4. Possible fundamental issue with parameter sharing in this domain

CONCLUSION:
All 4 training attempts failed to achieve stable coordination:
- Baseline: Extreme oscillations
- Improved: Complete inaction (11.39 attendance)
- Multi-bars (homogeneous): Complete inaction (0.5 per bar)
- Multi-bars (heterogeneous): Partial inaction (9 per bar)

The El Farol problem appears inherently difficult for standard MARL algorithms.
