MULTI-BARS TRAINING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
  Episodes: 1000
  Consumers: 180
  Bars: 3 (optimal capacity: 60 each)
  Price sensitivity: ×1.5

RESULTS:
  Avg Attendance/Bar: 1.27
  Total Attendance: 3.80 / 180
  Avg Price: $14.27
  Consumer Reward: 81998

PROBLEM:
  Conservative Learning Trap (same as Improved baseline)
  - Consumers learned staying home = optimal
  - Bars have almost no customers (<1 person)
  - Prices remain at maximum (no competition pressure)

ROOT CAUSE:
  1. Consumer epsilon reached 0.01 too quickly
  2. Staying home reward (5.0) is safer than risky coordination
  3. Empty bars → bad experience → reinforces staying home
  4. Circular trap: nobody goes → nobody wants to go

IMPLICATIONS FOR REPORT:
  - Demonstrates coordination failure in multi-agent RL
  - Risk-averse convergence in complex games
  - Need for reward engineering or forced exploration
